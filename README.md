# Azure Dashboard Demo

![project image](https://az400assets.blob.core.windows.net/dashboard-markdown/img1.png)

You can use any combination of plain text, Markdown syntax, and HTML content on the markdown tile. The Azure portal uses an open-source library called [marked](https://marked.js.org/) to transform your content into HTML that is shown on the tile.

## Avoid

- JavaScript â€“ script tags and inline JavaScript evaluations will be removed.
- iframes - ifram tags will be removed.
- Style - style tags will be removed.

    *Inline style attributes on HTML elements aren't officially supported. You may find that some inline style elements work for you, but if they interfere with the layout of the portal, they could stop working at any time. The Markdown tile is intended for basic, static content that uses the default styles of the portal.*

## Examples

### Code snippets

```csharp
using system.net

namespace Project Namespace

public async Task<obj> Main(){
   ...
}
```

### Strikethrough

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.

### Use HTML for tables
